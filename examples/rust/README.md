# Rust VMM example

This example shows how to use the
[Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) with libvmm.
This example is similar to the [simple example](../simple) in that it boots a
simple Linux guest with a basic command line over serial.

The Rust VMM only supports the QEMU virt AArch64 platform as the goal of this
example is to simply show how to use the libvmm library (despite being written in
C) and call it from a Rust program. This specific example uses manual FFI
bindings to call into libvmm, but you could use [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen)
or make your own Rust-like bindings. However for a minimal VMM as we have in this
example, manual bindings are sufficient.

It should also be noted that this example makes use of the
[rust-seL4](https://github.com/seL4/rust-seL4/) project's support for Microkit.

## Building the example

You will first need to have Rust installed, the instructions for this are [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

From here, you build the example with:
```sh
make MICROKIT_SDK=/path/to/sdk
```

By default the build system fetches the Linux kernel and initrd images from
Trustworthy Systems' website on-demand. To override this anduse your own images,
specify `LINUX` and/or `INITRD`. For example:

```sh
make MICROKIT_SDK=/path/to/sdk LINUX=/path/to/linux INITRD=/path/to/initrd
```

## Running the example

You can build and run the example in a single command with:
```sh
make MICROKIT_SDK=/path/to/sdk qemu
```
